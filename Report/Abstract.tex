\chapter*{Abstract}

This Master thesis in computational science and engineering depicts the issues arising from transport in porous media and the effect of molecular diffusion. An introduction present the theoretical framework of porous media fluid dynamic as well as stochastic modelization of such system. The introduction contains a literature review that reports and compares three recent publication on the topic as well.
In response to the reviewed scientific literature, the influence of molecular diffusion is investigated in from advective ($\mathrm{Pe} = 0$) to fully diffusive regimes ($\mathrm{Pe}\rightarrow \infty$) with the help of a particle tracking program using the \citet{Pollock1988} algorithm equipped with a recent diffusion algorithm developed by D. Meyer. 
Numerical simulations were performed on the ETH Zürich EULER cluster which was a good occasion to test the portability of the code.
\textit{Conclusion, à quoi tout ça à servit...}
