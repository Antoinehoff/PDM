\chapter*{Abstract}

This Master thesis in computational science and engineering depicts the issues rising from transport in porous media and the effect of molecular diffusion in an existing Lagrangian numerical model. \\
In response to a short literature review comparing three recent papers (\citet{Puyguiraud2019},\citet{Dentz2017},\citet{Meyer2016}), numerical simulations were performed on the ETH ZÃ¼rich EULER clusters with the aim to reproduce the results of \citet{Meyer2016} at purely advective regime ($\mathrm{Pe}=\infty$) and extend them to advection diffusion regimes ($\mathrm{Pe}<\infty$).
The post processing algorithm used to obtain the presented results are explicitly described and the routines have been written in \textsc{Python} especially for this work.\\
