@article{Darcy1856,
abstract = {Fountains in Dijon After Darcy's graduation he was assigned by the Corps to a position in the Department of Jura, which bordered C{\^{o}}te d'Or. At the specific request of the Prefect of C{\^{o}}te d'Or, he was transferred to Dijon. It seems curious that a 23 year old, junior engineer received such treatment. His latter relative, Paul Darcy attributed it to his already established reputation, but it seems more likely that that his family still had influence with the Prefecture. Within two years, in 1828 he married Henriette Carey. She was an English native from the Isle of Guernesey, whose family was living in Dijon. They remained together until his death, and Henriette never remarried. At this point it may be appropriate to comment on Darcy's name. It was Henry Philibert Gaspard Darcy; not Henri. The proper spelling may be seen in the title page of Les Fontaines Publiques de la Ville de Dijon, and on his grave (Phillip, 1995). Alan Freeze (1994) has speculated that since Darcy's English wife spelled her name as the French Henriette, he may have had assumed the English Henry. However, Fancher (1956) has published an 1821 school portrait of Darcy that appears to carry the original title, "Henry Darcy". In should be noted that after his death, some French publications introduced the spelling "Henri", but his own family has never used anything but Henry. Some have spelled his last name d'Arcy. That is also wrong; check his papers and his grave. However, he started his life with that aristocratic spelling. After his father's death, both Henry and Hughes had a private tutor, who lent their mother money. A Jacobian opposed to the aristocracy and all things aristocratic, he forced the boys to change the spelling to Darcy (Paul Dacy, 1957). All in all, a hyphen was probably a small price to pay for an education. The 1830 revolution was followed by the 18 years of relative stability, prosperity and moderate rule of the constitutional ruler, King Louis Philippe (the Duke of Orleans). As each ruler before him since Napoleon, Louis Philippe supported building projects to provide visible evidence of the value of his authority. His policies combined with the continuing advances of the industrial revolution, brought steady improvement to the country. After his return to Dijon Darcy's first task would prove instrumental in focusing his engineering experience and research in hydraulics. He set out to provide a clean, dependable water supply to the city. The city had perhaps the worst water in Europe (Paul Darcy, 1957). A number of proposals had been made, but each had design flaws. He reviewed the previous designs and set out to develop one that worked. In 1834 Darcy published "Rapport A M. le Maire et au Conseil Municipal de Dijon sur les Moyens de Fournir L'Eau Necessaire a Cette Ville" (Report to the Mayor and the Town Council of Dijon on the Means of Providing Necessary Water to the City). His design provided for the collection of 8 m3/min at the spring of the Rosoir. The water was then carried in a 12.7 km underground aqueduct to a covered 5,700 m3 reservoir located near the Porte Guillaume and another reservoir at Montmusard. Local distribution lines totaling 28,000 m were lain underground and delivered water to public fountains, hospitals and major buildings. One hundred and forty two street fountains were spaced 100 m apart. His plan for Dijon's water supply was approved by the Municipal Council with no revision on March 5, 1835. On December 31, 1835, a Royal ordinance declared the Dijon water project a public utility, which allowed for land acquisition. The construction contract was awarded in July, 1838 and work began the following year on March 21, 1839. Thus, about five years had past between Darcy's initial report and building inauguration. While the project had proceeded slowing, his career had not. In May of 1840 Darcy was appointed Chief Engineer for the Department of C{\^{o}}te d'Or. Once initiated, work proceeded very quickly. On September 6, 1840, water was delivered to the Reservoir of the Porte Guillaume, 535 days after construction start. The speed of work would suggest that Darcy had done extensive preparation during the five previous years, and possibly, some features were started earlier. In any case, the construction of the covered aqueduct in that period implies an impressive average daily rate of 24 m/day. Work on water distribution and delivery components continued until 1844, when the project was substantially completed. Darcy incorporated the St. Pierre Basin Fountain into the Dijon water system (Darcy 1856; Plate 19, Figure 1). Separate valves controlled the inner and other jets, which allowed variations in both the height and shape of the display. It was an impressive technological feat for the day as evidenced by the report of Dumay (1845), "On July 28, 1841, in the middle of the rejoicing of a public festival, a fountain made up of 17 jets that exceeds 13 meters in height, sprang majestically at the entrance of one of our promenades, and for that time has not ceased to bring the admiration of foreigners who visit our beautiful city." Darcy was not content with just enjoying the display. His 1856 report devoted several pages to a theoretical analysis and experimental verification of the jet flow as a function of the height of the water system's two reservoirs. As construction drew to a close, Darcy began to receive recognition for his efforts. On August 31, 1842 Henry was awarded the Legion of Honor after recommendation by the Prefect of C{\^{o}}te d'Or and the Minister of the Interior. At the project completion, he accepted a gold medal from the Municipal Council, and a laurel wreath from the workmen. This was followed two years later in 1846 by a Municipal Council resolution to provide him free water for life. The source of Darcy's popularity was twofold. First, the project was a success and the quality of life for the citizens of Dijon must have been noticeably improved. Paul Darcy wrote, to understand his enthusiastic recognition by the people of Dijon, it must be recalled that the town had at its disposition only wells plus the waters, often inadequate, always in short supply and dirty, of the Ouche, that the well waters were not protected from contamination of all kinds; that the town was crossed by the ancient bed of a small stream, the Suzon, and that this ditch, uncovered over almost all its length, with no part paved, served over a length of 1,300 meters as the main sewer for wastes of every kind, for dwellings and adjoining industrial establishments (such as the tripe-makers of the rue du Bourg); that it was never cleaned, that it was never flushed out, and that, above all during hot weather, the town was poisoned by pestilential odors." (Translation by J. Phillip, 1995) The picture at left shows a Paris street, which would have been typical for all cities at that time. Clearly, as the provider of clean water for drinking and flushing the sewers, Darcy would be a popular guy. His contribution is even more significant when it is considered that Paris did not obtain similar service until roughly 20 years later after the massive urban renewal of Haussmann. Dijon was no longer a backwater, it was a leader. The second factor in Darcy's popularity was his unselfish nature. As designer and project manager of the water system, he was entitled to a fee of 55,000 francs. He refused that payment, and took the laurel wreath and medal instead. Phillip (1995) estimates that in current dollars the fee would equal about {\$}1,500,000. While turning down that money, he repaid with interest his scholarship at the Polytechnic. All accounts of Darcy describe his "d{\'{e}}sint{\'{e}}ressement". The word carries more meaning than the English "disinterest". It implies the complete suspension of one's own selfish interests. The inscription on his medal provides a good indication of the public's opinion of him (edited from Phillip, 1995),},

@article{Dentz2017,
abstract = {This paper studies the mechanisms of dispersion in the laminar flow through the pore space of a {\$}3{\$}-dimensional porous medium. We focus on pre-asymptotic transport prior to the asymptotic hydrodynamic dispersion regime, in which solute motion may be described by the average flow velocity and a hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient. High performance numerical flow and transport simulations of solute breakthrough at the outlet of a sand-like porous medium evidence marked deviations from the hydrodynamic dispersion paradigm and identifies two distinct regimes. The first regime is characterized by a broad distribution of advective residence times in single pores. The second regime is characterized by diffusive mass transfer into low-velocity region in the wake of solute grains. These mechanisms are quantified systematically in the framework of a time-domain random walk for the motion of marked elements (particles) of the transported material quantity. The model is parameterized with the characteristics of the porous medium under consideration and captures both pre-asymptotic regimes. Macroscale transport is described by an integro-differential equation for solute concentration, whose memory kernels are given in terms of the distribution of mean pore velocities and trapping times. This approach quantifies the physical non-equilibrium caused by a broad distribution of mass transfer time scales, both advective and diffusive, on the representative elementary volume (REV). Thus, while the REV indicates the scale at which medium properties like porosity can be uniquely defined, this does not imply that transport can be characterized by hydrodynamic dispersion.},

@article{Bijeljic2013,
abstract = {[1] We study and explain the origin of early breakthrough and long tailing plume behavior by simulating solute transport through 3-D X-ray images of six different carbonate rock samples, representing geological media with a high degree of pore-scale complexity. A Stokes solver is employed to compute the flow field, and the particles are then transported along streamlines to represent advection, while the random walk method is used to model diffusion. We compute the propagators (concentration versus displacement) for a range of Peclet numbers (Pe) and relate it to the velocity distribution obtained directly on the images. There is a very wide distribution of velocity that quantifies the impact of pore structure on transport. In samples with a relatively narrow spread of velocities, transport is characterized by a small immobile concentration peak, representing essentially stagnant portions of the pore space, and a dominant secondary peak of mobile solute moving at approximately the average flow speed. On the other hand, in carbonates with a wider velocity distribution, there is a significant immobile peak concentration and an elongated tail of moving fluid. An increase in Pe, decreasing the relative impact of diffusion, leads to the faster formation of secondary mobile peak(s). This behavior indicates highly anomalous transport. The implications for modeling field-scale transport are discussed. Citation: Bijeljic, B., P. Mostaghimi, and M. J.

abstract = {We devise an efficient methodology to provide a universal statistical description of advection-dominated dispersion (P´ eclet→∞) in natural porous media including carbonates. First, we investigate the dispersion of tracer particles by direct numerical simulation (DNS). The transverse dispersion is found to be essentially determined by the tortuosity and it approaches a Fickian limit within a dozen characteristic scales. Longitudinal dispersion was found to be Fickian in the limit for bead packs and superdiffusive for all other natural media inspected. We demonstrate that the Lagrangian velocity correlation length is a quantity that characterizes the spatial variability for transport. Finally, a statistical transport model is presented that sheds light on the connection between pore-scale characteristics and the resultingmacroscopic transport behavior. Our computationally efficient model accurately reproduces the transport behavior in longitudinal direction and approaches the Fickian limit in transverse direction.},

abstract = {This new edition of Quantitative Sociodynamics presents a general strategy for interdisciplinary model building and its application to a quantitative description of behavioral changes based on social interaction processes. Originally, the crucial methods for the modeling of complex systems (stochastic methods and nonlinear dynamics) were developed in physics and mathematics, but they have very often proven their explanatory power in chemistry, biology, economics and the social sciences as well. Quantitative Sociodynamics provides a unified and comprehensive overview of the different stochastic methods, their interrelations and properties. In addition, it introduces important concepts from nonlinear dynamics (e.g. synergetics, chaos theory). The applicability of these fascinating concepts to social phenomena is carefully discussed. By incorporating decision-theoretical approaches, a fundamental dynamic model is obtained, which opens new perspectives in the social sciences. It includes many established models as special cases, e.g. the logistic equation, the gravity model, some diffusion models, evolutionary game theory and social field theory. Moreover, it implies numerous new results and is relevant for various application areas, such as opinion formation, migration, the self-organization of behavioral conventions, and the behavior of customers and voters. Theoretical results are complemented and illustrated by numerous computer simulations. Quantitative Sociodynamics is relevant both for social scientists and natural scientists who are interested in the application of stochastic and synergetics concepts to interdisciplinary topics.},

abstract = {We provide a physically based explanation for the complex macroscopic behavior of dispersion in porous media as a function of Peclet number, Pe, using a pore-scale network model that accurately predicts the experimental dependence of the longitudinal dispersion coefficient, D L , on Pe. The asymptotic dispersion coefficient is only reached after the solute has traveled through a large number of pores at high Pe. This implies that preasymptotic dispersion is the norm, even in experiments in statistically homogeneous media. Interpreting transport as a continuous time random walk, we show that (1) the power law dispersion regime is controlled by the variation in average velocity between throats (the distribution of local Pe), giving D L ∼ Pe $\delta$ with $\delta$ = 3 − $\beta$ ≈ 1.2, where $\beta$ is an exponent characterizing the distribution of transit times between pores, (2) the crossover to a linear regime D L ∼ Pe for Pe {\textgreater} Pe crit ≈ 400 is due to a transition from a diffusion-controlled late time cutoff to transport governed by advective movement, and (3) the transverse dispersion coefficient D T ∼ Pe for all Pe 1.},
